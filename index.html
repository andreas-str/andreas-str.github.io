								<p>
									Hi I'm Andreas and I'm an Embedded Systems Engineer.<br /> 
									I work with electronics, do both hardware and soft/firmware work,
									and am a massive fan of the aviation and rocketry industry.<br />
									<br />
									I have an interest in developing new technology, as well as repairing and reusing.
									You may also find me modifying and tweaking products to do cool things or make them do things they weren't designed to do.<br />
									<br />
									Everything that can be hacked, will be hacked.

								<h2 class="major">Projects</h2>
								<p>
									Here you can find some of the projects I have done in my spare time mainly for fun. 
									Some of them go back before I even finished highschool, while others are not properly 
									documented anywhere and only few spare images exist.
								</p>
								<h2>LCD LED Projector</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/projector1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									This was the first major project I ever attempted in highschool. I got the idea from a youtube video where
									someone had created a home theater projector on their own, and I wanted to make one as well.
									The complexity of such a project is pretty easy for a knowledgeable engineer, but for me, not
									having a clue how electronics worked made for some very creative solutions.
								</p>
								<p>
									The projector works by having a 30W LED act as the backlight to a 3.5” LCD screen. 
									By using a lens to focus the light evenly on the screen, the screen is then projected to a wall
									This projector also incorporated playback from a USB drive, which was achieved by
									cannibalizing a portable dvd player that had that functionality.
								</p>
								<p>
									While the whole design could have been a lot, and I mean a lot better, I feel proud for making
									this and actually using it to watch movies with friends during the summer. I dedicated a lot of time
									and love to make it happen, and it still works to this day.

								<h2>Raspberry Pi Laptop</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/laptop1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									This project took way longer to complete than it ever should have. I had this idea of making my
									own laptop after messing around with the original Raspberry Pi, so obviously I looked up on the 
									internet to see if others had done it. To my surprise, nobody had gone all in on such a project, 
									instead using power banks and bluetooth keyboards on a case and calling it a laptop.
								</p>
								<p>
									I wanted to go all in, and create a fully functioning laptop, and so I did. This was the first project I
									made a 3D model out of, as you can see below. 
								</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/laptop2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									A little more info regarding the electronics, a Raspberry Pi 2 
									is used, with all plugs and connectors removed to reduce height. The screen is a 7” LCD panel at 720p resolution, 
									with its own controller. The keyboard is a USB keyboard taken out of a tablet case. The trackpad is a very old 
									PS/2 trackpad taken out of an HP laptop, and a PS/2 to USB adapter is used as well. There is a 2W stereo amplifier 
									and stereo speakers from the aforementioned HP laptop, as well as a USB WiFi module, an SD card reader, and a 3 port USB hub.
									Lastly, the battery is a 10.000mAh li-on battery with both the cells and charge/discharge and boost circuitry taken out of a power bank.
									As for the mechanical aspects, the whole laptop is made out of 1mm aluminium sheet that is bent and cut to shape. 
									The electronics are attached using either superglued nuts for the big components, like the main PCBs, or hot glue for other smaller components.
